      I am a Graphic Programmer working at <a href="https://www.kojimaproductions.jp/en">Kojima Productions</a>.
      In particular, I work on raytracing and screen space effects for the AAA game Death Stranding 2.

    <p>
      Previously, I worked on compilers, and, in particular, on the Java Virtual Machine.
      I developed an ahead-of-time Java to native pipeline, and added self-debugging to it.

      I received my Ph.D. from the Graduate School of Information Science and Technology (情報科学研究科) at <a href="https://www.osaka-u.ac.jp/en">Osaka University (大阪大学)</a>, Japan.
      I was member of the <a href="https://sel.ist.osaka-u.ac.jp">Software Engineering laboratory</a>, led by <a href="https://sel.ist.osaka-u.ac.jp/people/inoue">Prof. Katsuro Inoue</a>.

      When not in front of a screen, I enjoy taking pictures, landscape ones in particular.
      But I have to admit, I spend most weekends implementing my own rendering engine ^^
